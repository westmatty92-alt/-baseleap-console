# MASTER BUILD GUIDE — Baseleap Console

## Architecture
- Single-file `index.html` front end + one Vercel serverless function (`api/ai.js`) as the AI proxy.
- Supabase: auth (single operator) + Postgres (seven tables, RLS) + Storage (uploaded client files).
- Deploy: Vercel. Front end is static; `/api/ai` runs as a Node function.
- The console embeds into GHL at the agency level via a custom menu link (iframe) once live.

## State model
- `S` is the global state object. `S.activeClientId` drives everything.
- `loadClient(id)` → `resetClientState()` → load → `render()`. Always in that order.
- The selected client is the only context; modules read/write rows keyed to it.

## Known-bug checklist (run before every commit)
- [ ] No raw fetch to api.anthropic.com — all AI via `ai()` / `/api/ai`.
- [ ] Every insert stamps `operator_id` (RLS).
- [ ] New per-client state added to `resetClientState()`.
- [ ] Modal backgrounds hardcoded hex, not CSS vars.
- [ ] No duplicate `let`/`const` names inside a function (SyntaxError trap).
- [ ] Brace balance check passes.
- [ ] AI JSON parsed defensively (strip ```fences, wrap in try/catch) — or use a second extraction call.
- [ ] Tested after deploy: hard refresh, check console for errors.

## Feasibility gate (the core business rule, enforced by data)
Gaps are written by the Audit Assistant with `validation_status = 'pending'`. The Automation Agent
sets `feasible`, `mechanism`, `estimated_hours`, and flips `validation_status` to `validated`.
The Gap Report Builder reads ONLY validated gaps. An unvalidated gap cannot reach the client.

## Pulse vs Console (don't confuse them)
- Pulse = client-facing product, deployed into client sub-accounts, resold. Separate repo.
- Console = internal, agency-level, one operator. This repo. No multi-tenant brand switching,
  no rebilling — but the client-switcher still needs the state-reset discipline above.
